Self reminder: When designing high-level model pipelines + dbt model structuring, keep in mind of how to deprecate models as well:
1. static tables - models that are no longer updated, yet still necessary for pipelines (eg: union old data, left join to get more attribution, etc)
2. KIV? - keep the script as backup, and do not delete the physical table yet.
3. Total removal - we can delete the physical table as well.

With these things structured nicely, we can write macros to drop tables programatically.
