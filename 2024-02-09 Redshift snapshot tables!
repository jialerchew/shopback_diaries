We often have the need to create "snapshot" tables routinely for all sorts of reason - backup, audit, incident management, etc.

ShopBack had a "spring cleaning" session (cost-cutting) because table storage in Redshift costs $$$. I was quite surprised that we were paying 4 figures a month just to maintain a bunch of snapshot tables.

- some snapshot tables for auditing can't be helped. They are compulsory.
- for the rest, depending on use case, we can recover the tables from cluster snapshots!

- we can actually store up to 35 days worth of cluster snapshots.
