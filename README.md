# ShopBack Diaries
This is a diary of my experience and learnings in ShopBack. Since this is a diary, it is meant to be unpolished and simple. I wouldn't want to feel pressured having to proofread and put too much thoughts into readability and presentation.

With that said, hopefully this initiative will last throughout my career in ShopBack!

Motivations:
1. Document my learnings and thoughts.
2. Borrowed a split keyboard from my friend. Time to practice proper touch typing!
